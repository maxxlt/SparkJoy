/*
 NOTE: This class is used as a work-around in SwiftUI, because a SwiftUI View CANNOT conform to an ObjC protocol,
 which the SDK's WIFI/Network search REQUIRES.
 
 NOTE: In a UIKit ViewController, normally you would conform to the BRPtouchNetworkDelegate protocol (as we do here)
 and implement both "startSearch" and the "didFinishSearch" delegate callback method that SDK sends when search is completed.
 
 NOTE: As part of the work-around, I've create a custom "wifiSearchNotificationName" that we will post when "didFinishSearch" fires.
 Caller should handle this notification, and the search results will be available in our "discoveredPrinterList".
